I'm a PhD student in the School of Informatic Department of [City University London](http://www.city.ac.uk). I advised by [George Spanoudakis](http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~gespan/). My research subject is network security special for [Botnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet). My Bachelor and Master graduated from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics [NUAA](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn) which focus on the distributed computating. The first programe language is C++, but now I use many tools in my research, such as Java, Python, even DOS batch. I'm a co-founder of [IDAOYOO](http://www.idaoyoo.com) which is a Chinese tour guide social network based in London. 

You can know more about me in the [homepage](/) and my [vitae](../vitae/). This blog site, as its name indicates, is about Computer Science.

This site was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the template was derived from the site [setImpl](http://lhzhang.com/) by Linghua Zhang; the homepage was based on the design of [Tao Zhang](http://ztpala.com/) (thanks a lot, guys!). You may need a decent web browser to view this site (such as Firefox or Chrome), otherwise the layout can be a mess and the fonts can look ugly. You can navigate to the last post by the left-arrow key (`<-`) or next post by right-arrow (`->`), or equivalently keys `J` and `K`.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/xinmeng1/) or Twitter [@xinmeng_1](http://twitter.com/xinmeng_1) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/xinmeng1). Subscribe to the RSS feed of [blog posts](../feed/) or [all comments](http://mengxin.disqus.com/latest.rss) to stay tuned.
