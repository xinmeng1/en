## Curriculum Design of Core Undergraduate Courses

Sept 2006 - Sept 2010 _Learner_

During 4 years studying of undergraduate, I have learned nearly all the core courses about the computer sciences. Except the basic knowledge, I also in-depth study expanded knowledge and used it for the curriculum design. I just list some of the most importance computer-science-related courses as follows:

- __Class Information Management System(for Data structure course)__: I used C++ to realize
the system which includes nearly all the important data structure for programming. In addition, I learned visual programming based the __MFC__ using __Visual Studio 6.0__ by myself and applied it to the implementation of the system.
- __Visual comparison for Sorting Algorithms(for algorithms course)__: Excepting realize nearly all
sorting algorithm in __C++__, I also use the __TeeChart__(which is a Charting Library can be integrated in MFC) to present the spatial-temporal complexity intuitively.
- __Library Management System (for software engineering course)__: I designed the system based on the object-oriented software design including user case diagram, class diagram and so on. I used the __Rational Rose__ which is an object-oriented Unified Modeling Language (__UML__) software design tool to design the project.

## Research of UCON Based FTP Access Monitoring System

May 2010 - Sept 2010, Leader

This is the Final Year Project of undergraduate. The research is deep analyses the application technology on UCON access control model, and present the __UCON-based__ access control model for FTP. And it uses the set of predicates and finite automatic machine to describe the UCON model formally. And through the __network packet capture technology__, and communication blocking technology, it designs the UCON based FTP access monitoring system, then it uses __Libnids__ development kit and __filter-hook__ packet filter driver model to implement the excess to download real-time network packet block.

## TMMS (Trend Micro Mobile Security) Mobile Application

May 2009 - May 2010, _QA intern_

The TMMS is one of famous mobile anti-malware application. What I have done for the project is software testing for the TMMS on Windows Mobile and Symbian Operation System. Through the project, I became familiar with the __Software Testing engineering__ and I also learned to use the tracking system for software development projects such as __Trac__ and the virtual machine tools such as __VMWare Workstation__.

## The Simulation Software for Collaborative Against

June 2010 - Oct 2010, _Participant_

I was responsible for a small part of the project which is the visualization of the performance of the units. I became familiar with the drawing with __MFC__ and implementation a display which is similar with the Performance of Task Manager on Windows.

## Competition:Second Google Android Competition in China

Jan 2011 - May 2011, _Leader_

I Organized a team to attend this competition, and we developed a Special Alarm on Android platform. The innovation of the application is introducing the social network thinking. We defined a universal format (__XML__) of the alarm and the user can share their alarms with their friend such as "Fitness Plan" and "When you need to brush your teeth". I was responsible for __the design of the application__ and implementation the XML file store and parse on __Android development__. I was even in charge of the __UI design__ with my skilled __Photoshop__ knowledge. The project got the “Excellence awards in Google Android Competition in East China”

## Competition: “Huawei Cup” Computer programming contest

June 2011 - August 2011, __Leader__

I chose the project of __URL Matching Algorithm__ Research and Implementation. I developed a software which can match the specific URLs in the database base on given rules including some wildcard character. During the project, I used 3 core algorithms to satisfy the requirement of time&space complexity which include __KMP string searching algorithm, Deterministic finite automaton(DFA) and Rule-base classification__. At last I implemented the system based on __C#__ using __Visual Studio 2005__. The project got the third prize of the competition.

## Carrier-based Cluster System

June 2011 - August 2012, __Leader__

The system is used for improving the robustness and effectiveness of computing task on the ship. I was responsible for the design of the system and the implementation of the virtual storage management component. The project is based on the embedded system(__VxWorks__). So we depended on embedded __C programming__ to implement the system by using __Wind River Workbench__.

## The Distributed and Parallel Computing for Large Scale Matrix

Feb 2011 - May 2011, __Participant__

I performed some experiments which is based on the previous research. These experiments were computation of large matrix by using parallel programming. I became familiar with the __MPI__(Message Passing Interface) and the __LAPACK__ which is linear algebra library.

## IDAOYOO Website

May 2013 - Nov 2014, __Leader__

I was the co-founder of the IDAOYOO.COM website and was responsible for all the technical problems. The IDAOYOO.COM website is a social network which can connect the Chinese tour guides and tourists. The website is based on the __PHP__ and __MySQL__. I implemented the system based on open source project named __Thinksns__ and developed some application on the platform. I was familiar with the PHP, MySQL and mastered the website deployment techniques.

## IDAOYOO Mobile Application

Dec 2014 - June 2015, __Leader__

In order to let the users access the social network easily, the project of mobile applications is performed. I was responsible for the __requirement analysis __and __top-level design__ for the application. Meanwhile, I participated in solving the important technique problem especially for the Android application.

## Mobile Botnet Detection System Research and Implementation

Sept 2012 - Current, __Leader__

The main project for my PhD research. In order to realize the system to detect the mobile Botnet on Android platform, there are a lot of work during my research. Firstly, I in-depth studied the __knowledge of network__ and I was familiar with the traffic monitor toolkit __WireShark__. In addition, I made some research for the “PCAP” format traffic file and used __JNetPcap__ to implement the __PCAP__ file parser by using __JAVA__. Secondly, I studied the __Machine learning__ Classifications and became familiar with the open source machine learning toolkit __WEKA__. I used the toolkit to classify the traffic based on selected features. At last, I enhanced my __Android development__ skills to implement the detection system on the Android platform which had been published on conference named "CRISIS2015". In current, I am working on the experiments by analyzing the traffic and system call on the mobile system. I had implement some __Linux Shell Script__ (which can be run on the Linux kernel of Android operation system) to capture the system call for the specific process.
