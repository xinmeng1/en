You can know more about me in the [homepage](/) and my [vitae](../vitae/). This blog site, as its name indicates, is about Computer Science.

This site was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the template was derived from the site [setImpl](http://lhzhang.com/) by Linghua Zhang; the homepage was based on the design of [Tao Zhang](http://ztpala.com/) (thanks a lot, guys!). You may need a decent web browser to view this site (such as Firefox or Chrome), otherwise the layout can be a mess and the fonts can look ugly. You can navigate to the last post by the left-arrow key (`<-`) or next post by right-arrow (`->`), or equivalently keys `J` and `K`.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/xinmeng1/) or Twitter [@xinmeng_1](http://twitter.com/xinmeng_1) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/xinmeng1). Subscribe to the RSS feed of [blog posts](../feed/) or [all comments](http://mengxin.disqus.com/latest.rss) to stay tuned.
