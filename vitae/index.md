## Key Transferable Skills

### Problem Solving:

To achieve the target of my Ph.D. project, I had to solve a series of problems including how to distinct the malware and normal applications and which features could be used for detection. According to a lot of experiments, I found that it is feasible to detect the malware by analysing some specific features of traffic.

### Learning Capability:

During the period of Ph.D., I learnt a lot of knowledge by myself for the research. Such as learning Linux shell script to monitor system calls on the Android platform and learning VBA script to analyse huge data automatically. I am good at studying and taking advantage of the new technology and existing toolkit. Such as to implement analysis of PCAP file, I made use of JNetPcap, which is a powerful open-source Java library for network analysis. I also learnt
the L ATEX to write my publication and thesis.

### Data Analysis:

Machine Learning and statistic analysis play an important role in my research. These techniques are essential for data analysis. Such as I used the machine learning classification to analyse the traffic data on the mobile device to find the distinction between normal and abnormal. I also performed T-Test and ANOVA to analyse the differences
among different groups data.
